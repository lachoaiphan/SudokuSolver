# Sudoku Solver

>
This project is part of the Piscine program at 42 Silicon Valley that
requires us to create an unique solution for a partially filled sudoku. Within this
project contains my implementation which involves recursion, a backtracking
algorithm, and a command-line display to input a 8x8 chessboard.
